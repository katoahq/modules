### Contributing to Katoa Modules

Currently, [@katoahq/modules](https://github.com/katoahq/modules) is the home
to all verified Katoa modules.

Contributing is easy:

1. Go to `src/`
2. Create a folder with the module name you want
3. Copy the structure of an existing module (we suggest the `node/`) module
4. Have at it!

Your module should be a step or a job.

### Helpful hacks

ChatGPT is ridiuclously simple. Copy and paste our schema + add a paragraph
about the module you want to create and it will do 99% of it for you... It's
wild.

Copy and paste the first question in this
[ChatGPT conversation](https://sharegpt.com/c/50jlJWL) and amend the last
paragraph to whatever you'd like.
